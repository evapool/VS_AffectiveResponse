1.	Software to download
1.	PyMVPA http://www.pymvpa.org/index.html
1.	Install in python 2.7 to be compatible with my code
2.	PyMVPAw https://github.com/rystoli/PyMVPAw
1.	Helpful wrappers and help functions for PyMVPA
2.	Run glm_scripts/beta_everytrial_pav.m 
1.	This uses SPM to create a beta for every trial in every voxel. These betas are then transformed to t-stats and used as examples in MVPA. 
2.	Other non value related events are modeled to regress out things related to motor response, stimulus onset, etc. 
3.	Run glm_scripts/create_examples_tstats_pav.m
1.	Section 1 of this script creates a contrast and t-stat for every trial 
2.	Section 2 concatenates these t maps into a 4D volume that can be used for MVPA
1.	MVPA data structure will be a matrix with dimensions: num trials x num voxels
4.	Classification
1.	Run mvpa_main
1.	Implements a full brain searchlight w/ SVM as the classifier 
1.	Default implementation is CS+ vs. CS-
2.	Modify class_dict to customize how trials should be labeled by classifier 
3.	Cross validates by run
1.	Default is to exclude 3rd run, change this with runs2use variable
2.	MVPA Statistics
1.	Option 1 - quick but not optimal
1.	Conduct a typical 2nd level group analysis/t-test with SPM using accuracy minus chance maps for every subject (H0: accuracy=50%)
2.	Option 2 - nonparametric permutation tests
1.	There’s much debate on how to do this but we will probably be safe with the procedure in this paper
1.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912009810?via%3Dihub#bb0035
2.	Run mvpa_perms_1stlevel for each subject
1.	100 permutations per subject
3.	Transform accuracy map and permutation map to standard space 
4.	Run mvpa_perms_2ndlevel
5.	Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)
1.	Run rsa_main
1.	Implements a full brain searchlight correlating voxel patterns to a model dissimilarity matrix (DSM)
1.	Default implement is finding correlations to a CS+/CS- representation
2.	Modify class_dict to customize how trials should be labeled by model DSM
3.	Partials out the correlation due to between run variance (this reduces confounds)
4.	Default is to exclude 3rd run, change this with runs2use variable
5.	Change plot_dsm to True to visualize what the model DSMs look like
2.	RSA Statistics
1.	Option 1 - quick but not optimal
1.	Conduct a typical 2nd level group analysis/t-test with SPM using correlation maps for every subject (H0: r=0)
2.	Option 2 - nonparametric permutation tests
1.	There’s much debate on how to do this but we will probably be safe with the procedure in this paper
1.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912009810?via%3Dihub#bb0035
2.	Run rsa_perms_1stlevel for each subject
1.	100 permutations per subject
3.	Transform accuracy map and permutation map to standard space 
4.	Run mvpa_perms_2ndlevel
