ReadMe PIT:

The model with the asterix* are to ones to be compared

GLM-01: Control model, no modulators & durations = 0 (stick functions)
--> 1 cotrol contrast (Grips)

GLM-02: Main model, no modulators & durations = 1
--> 4 basic contrasts (CSp-CSm, CSp-Base,  CSp-CSm&Base, CSm-Base)

*GLM-03: Model with 1st level modulators & durations = 1 & mean centered & orth = 0
-->  8 contrasts (4 basic + 4 modulated contrasts)

GLM-03a: same as GLM-03 but for striatum only

*GLM-04: Model with 2nd level covariates & durations = 1 & rank norm by condition
-->  8 contrasts (4 basic + 4 modulated contrasts)

GLM-04a: same as GLM-04 but for striatum only

GLM-05: same as GLM-04 but without any mask
-->  8 contrasts (4 basic + 4 modulated contrasts)

GLM-06: CONN file for connectivity analysis (ROI-to-ROI and Seed-to-Voxel)

GLM-08: like GLM-04 but with change regressor added to CS as control of non interest

*GLM-09: like GLM-03 but with absolute change regressor added to CS as control of non interest

GLM-10: separating CS onset and Baseline onset and modulating by "VALUE" and "PE" (this model is just for fun)
 --> FOR FUN

FAIL: GLM-11: separating CS onset and Baseline onset and modulating by "VALUExEFFORT" as first level modulator and absolute change as control modulator
 --> FAIL: VALUE*EFFORT is too correlated with VALUE

FAIL: GLM-12: separating CS onset and Baseline onset and modulating by "VALUExEFFORT"
 --> FAIL: VALUE*EFFORT is too correlated with VALUE

*GLM-13: same as GLM 08 but coded in a similar was to GLM-10 which also kind of correspond to GLM-28 with control absolute change
 --> FOR FUN
