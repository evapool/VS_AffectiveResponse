 ReadMe PIT:


GLM-within: Model with 1st level modulators & durations = 1 & mean centered & orth = 0
-->  2 contrasts (1 basic + 1 modulated contrast)

GLM-between: Model with 2nd level covariates & durations = 1 & rank norm by condition
-->  1 contrast

GLM-within-control: like GLM-within but with absolute change regressor added to CS as control of non interest
-->  2 contrasts (1 basic + 1 modulated contrast)

GLM-between-control: same as GLM-between but with first level control regressor absolute change
-->  1 contrast
